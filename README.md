# Instagram for MacOS

![Instagram for MacOS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1655312/64683306-b2fd5400-d48b-11e9-9d08-6cf8917db131.png)

A simple application that will allow you to easily look at your Instagram account while working with Mac. 💻

I actually prepared this application to meet my own needs. <br>
I had to look at the phone every time to look at Instagram comments and messages (Direct). <br>
And when I picked up the phone, I was distracted. 📱😬

It has all the features in the mobile web version of Instagram.

### Differencies with fattihkoca's client:
- Ability to resize window
- Ability to maximize & put window to fullscreen
- Many (if not all) standard macOS shortcuts now work (thanks to a more complete macOS menu)

### TODO:
- probably an updater
